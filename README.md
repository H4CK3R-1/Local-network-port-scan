Interview Q&A
What is an open port?
A network port that accepts connections.

How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
It sends SYN packets and waits for SYN-ACK response.

What risks are associated with open ports?
Attackers can exploit services running on them.

Difference between TCP and UDP scanning?
TCP is connection-based; UDP is connectionless.

How can open ports be secured?
Use firewalls, disable unused services.

Firewall's role regarding ports?
Allows or blocks network traffic based on rules.

What is a port scan and why attackers do it?
Itâ€™s used to discover open ports to find potential attack vectors.

How does Wireshark help in scanning?
It captures and analyzes packets to see what's happening on the network.
